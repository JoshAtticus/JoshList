# JoshList
Pi-Hole Ad-list that blocks stuff the default StevenBlock list doesn't

## Lists
### [one.txt](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/JoshList/raw/main/one.txt)
Original JoshList, contains a few niche URLs

### [two.txt](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/JoshList/raw/main/two.txt)
Updated JoshList, aims for ~97% score on [d3ward's adblock tester](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock) when combined with StevenBlock

## Installing
Select the list you want above to get the direct URL, then go to your Pi-Hole, then Adlists in the sidebar, paste the raw URL into the first box and JoshList 2.0 in the second box, click add, then go to Tools > Update Gravity and then click the button to update.
